# Video Processing

Video processing is handled by [video.py](mdc:video.py) which provides an interface to FFmpeg.

## Key Functions

- **get_video_duration**: Determines video length in seconds
- **list_video_files**: Scans a directory for video files with specified extensions
- **create_concat_file**: Creates an FFmpeg concat format file for editing
- **compile_highlights**: Uses FFmpeg to concatenate highlight segments into a final video
- **create_thumbnail**: Extracts a frame from the video to use as a thumbnail

## FFmpeg Integration

The application uses FFmpeg's concat demuxer to efficiently join video segments without re-encoding, preserving quality while minimizing processing time.
