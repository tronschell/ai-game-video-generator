# Development Guide

Guidelines for development and contributions to the CS2 Highlight Generator.

## Project Structure

- **Code Organization**: Python modules are organized by functionality
- **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are defined in [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)
- **Model-driven**: Use Pydantic models from [models.py](mdc:models.py) for data validation and serialization

## Development Practices

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Document functions with docstrings
- Use Loguru for logging with appropriate levels
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Validation through Pydantic models

## Testing

To run the application in development mode, use:

```bash
python -m main --clips-folder "test_data" --output-length 2 --max-clips 3
```
