# Data Models

The application uses these key data models defined in [models.py](mdc:models.py):

## Main Models

- **HighlightSegment**: Represents a single highlight segment within a video
- **ClipAnalysis**: Full analysis of a video clip with identified highlights
- **SelectedHighlight**: A highlight segment selected for final compilation
- **CompilationPlan**: Plan for the final video compilation with selected highlights

## Database Representation

The [ClipDatabase](mdc:db.py) stores clips in SQLite with these fields:
- id (primary key)
- name (clip filename)
- path (absolute path to clip)
- analysis (JSON representation of ClipAnalysis)
- used_at (timestamp when used in compilation)
- created_at (timestamp when added to database)
