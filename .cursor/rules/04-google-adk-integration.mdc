# Google ADK Integration

This application uses Google's AI Development Kit (ADK) with Gemini Flash 2.5 to analyze CS2 gameplay videos.

## Key Components

- [agent_fn](mdc:agent.py) decorator in [agent.py](mdc:agent.py) defines the AI analysis function
- Video content is processed to identify:
  - Clutch moments (1v3, 1v4, 1v5)
  - Impressive kills (headshots, multikills)
  - Emotional reactions (indicated by loud microphone moments)

## Implementation

The `analyze_video` function in [agent.py](mdc:agent.py) processes video content and returns a structured analysis with highlight timestamps and descriptions.

This is wrapped by `process_video_with_agent()` which handles file I/O and conversion between ADK types and application models.
