# Logging System

The application uses Loguru for structured logging, configured in [logging_config.py](mdc:logging_config.py).

## Features

- Colorized console output
- File-based logging with rotation
- Different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR)
- Timestamps and contextual information

## Key Configuration

Logging is set up in the `setup_logging()` function which:
- Configures log location
- Sets up log rotation
- Defines log format
- Adds both console and file sinks

Logs provide detailed tracking of the application's workflow, making it easier to debug and monitor the highlight generation process.
